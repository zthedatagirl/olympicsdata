# OLYMPICS DATA: SQL ANALYSIS

I downloaded the 120 years of Olympic history dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about Olympic games held from 1896 to 2016. I answered questions obtained from techtfq.com. The dataset contains two tables: one about the athletes and the other about the regions.
